Subject: [Tstools-users] Moving tstools development to google code
Message-ID: <B47FF265-378D-47FB-878E-2C62BB2989F8@tibsnjoan.co.uk>

I am moving the development of the tstools project to google code, at:

    http://code.google.com/p/tstools/

This is mainly because I am using google code for the other open source projects I manage, and it will make it easier for me to actually work on tstools (I'm much more likely to check up on issues, etc., with a project there).

Beware - the new location is using mercurial instead of svn

I aim to produce a new binary release (at least for Windows) in the near future.

If you had commit privileges on the berlios version of the project, and don't yet have them on the google code version, please let me know (off-list!) an appropriate email address that you use to sign onto google code, so I can (re)add you. 

If there is anyone listening who isn't currently a committer, but feels they should be, ley me know and we can discuss it.

Tibs
